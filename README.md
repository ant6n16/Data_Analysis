# Data_Analysis

This repository contains the archives created for the project and the exam of the subject of Communication and Data Analysis in IoT of the master 
in Telecommunications Engineering. In this subject we work to learn to study data and apply different analysis tools, most of them based on Machine 
Learning. You can find in this repository two folders in which there is a txt or csv file with the data and a Python code to analyze it and try to 
draw all the possible conclusions. <br /> <br />
